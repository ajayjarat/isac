### About Me

My name is Josh Jackson and I am the senior agent developer and CTO for Intelligent Cyber Automations. I am an accomplished programmer and systems architect, and I enjoy using my skills to contribute to the exciting technological advances that happen every day at Intelligence Cyber Automations. I graduated from the Western Governors University in 2016 with a Bachelor's Degree in Information System Security. I have worked in the DoD cyber space for over 8 years and have been a key player in numerous successful audits for large DoD data centers.
